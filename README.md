# Spiral
A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an SQLalchemy database.

It can be found on telegram as [Spiral](https://t.me/enrapturedoverwatch_bot).
My goal is to create a group management platform to run numerous functions that are not yet upload to here. Perhaps in the future. A secondary goal was to make something that can run on the latest packages to avoid the dependency hell working with old ones.
Please report bugs to [Spiral Support](https://t.me/spiralsupport), where you can also ask for help setting up our bot in your group, and general enquiries, maybe ask new features.
Heavily modified version of [Kiygo](https://github.com/AnimeKaizoku/EnterpriseALRobot)
