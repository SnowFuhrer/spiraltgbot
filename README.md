# Spiral
!!!!!Almost completely broken as I work on the new ptb22 base!!!!
A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an SQLalchemy database.

It can be found on telegram as [Spiral](https://t.me/enrapturedoverwatch_bot).
The Support group can be reached out to at [Spiral Support](https://t.me/spiralsupport), where you can ask for help setting up our bot in your group, discover/request new features, report bugs, and stay in the loop whenever a new update is available.
Please note that this is a modified and not necessarily a very general group friendly version of [Kiygo](https://github.com/AnimeKaizoku/EnterpriseALRobot), and as such I recommend you to use that one.

## Setting up the bot (Read this before trying to use!):


# How to setup
